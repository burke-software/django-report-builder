#Quick Start Guide

##Requirements

Django 1.7 and Django Rest Framework 3.0. Users of older versions should continue to use the [2.x] branch instead. 
See setup.py for full requirements list.

##Installation

1. `pip install django-report-builder`
2. Add `report_builder` to INSTALLED_APPS
3. Add `url(r'^report_builder/', include('report_builder.urls'))` to url.py url patterns
3. Ensure `django.core.context_processors.static` and `django.core.context_processors.media` are in `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`
4. Sync your database. `python manage.py migrate` 
5. Use Django admin or navigate to /report_builder/

##Settings

### Include and exclude fields and models

    REPORT_BUILDER_INCLUDE = []
    REPORT_BUILDER_EXCLUDE = ['user'] # Allow all models except User to be accessed

### Per model settings

You may also limit which fields in a model can be used. Add this class and these properties to a model
This works similar to Django's Meta class.

    class ReportBuilder:
        exclude = ()  # Lists or tuple of excluded fields
        fields = ()   # Explicitely allowed fields
        extra = ()    # List extra fields (useful for methods)

Note you can add properties in a similair way as Django admin.

In previous versions of django-report-builder all properties were included by default.
They must now be explicitly included.

Moreover, we have added functionality to set fields to display by default. This is currently not valuable to the front-end that django-report-builder comes with, but if you have your own front-end then you could utilize this information. The aim is that when you select the model you want to filter on these fields would be selected as display defaults automatically.

    class ReportBuilder:
        defaults = () # Lists or tuple of defaults

The `defaults` field would usually be a subset of the `fields`. The idea is that you would have a `is_defualt` field on the JSON-frontend that would allow you to recognize that this is a default value on your own front-end.

### Custom model manager for all models

    REPORT_BUILDER_MODEL_MANAGER = 'on_site' #name of custom model manager to use on all models

You many also set a custom model manager per model. Just add the custom model manager and this property to a model

    report_builder_model_manager = on_site #reference to custom model manager to use for a model

### Export to Report

Admin action is disabled by default. To enable set
    
    REPORT_BUILDER_GLOBAL_EXPORT = True

This allows users to select lists of objects in django admin's change_list view and export them to a predefined report.
In effect bypasses the report's filters using the checked off objects instead.

### Asynchronous Report Generation

Sometimes it's useful to generate long running reports with a background worker. Defaults to off.
Advantages of this option

- Works better with Heroku which limits requests to 30 seconds
- Run a report, close your browser, come back later to a finished report
- Download the last report that was run instead of regenerating
- Nicer status messages about report status

### Turn off front-end

If you're developing your own front-end then you would need the ability to disable the front-end that comes with this package. To disable the built-in front-end:

    REPORT_BUILDER_FRONTEND = False

By default the front-end is turned on.

**Installation**

1. Set up Celery
2. Set `REPORT_BUILDER_ASYNC_REPORT = True` in settings.py
