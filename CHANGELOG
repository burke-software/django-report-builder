## 3.6 (WIP)

- Fix bug affecting Django 1.10 and 1.11
- Moved to tox for testing

## 3.5

- Compatible with Django 1.11
- Manifest containers only needed static assets, greatly reducing file size.
- No longer testing in Django 1.9, but probably still works.
- Remains in maintence mode - no features

## 3.4

- Switched from default angular theme to something more neutral
- Updated Angular Material version
- Some CSS fixes
- Limited Django 1.10 (use >=3.4.2) support see #239
- Django rest framework 3.4 support


## 3.3 

Official support is now for Django 1.8 and 1.9. Python 2.7 and 3.5 (I'm sure 3.4 works but no longer unit testing it). For Django < 1.8 please use the 3.2 release.
